Here is a to-do list. Proceed step-by-step, and in relatively small increments, so that if he hit a sesison limit, we won't be left with a large amout of work unfinished. document your progress through this to do list as you complete each task.

1) Consolidate the two Claude md files into a single one, make sure to update the directory structure and any reference to file names mentioned there, which may have changed in my recent manual refactoring of file naming and directory structure
2) Tidy up the scripts directory by moving the various scripts to the appropriate sub-directories, update README.md according to any changes to file location or naming
3) In data/raw/wind there are multiple files with 2025 wind data. Combine these files into a single one in chronological order (i.e., create a 2025.txt file like we have one for 2024 etc.). Once you are done and have checked that the combination of data was successful, move to a trash folder inside data the files that you have combined and are now redundant
4) Make it clear in claude.md that the data up to 2024 (2024 included) represent training data, whereas the 2025 data represent testing data. We are aiming for the wite to be live and officially in production with real-time forecasts as of January 1, 2026. 
5) Create a wind_2025_processed.txt file based on the available 2025 data consolidated as per point 3, similarly as you created the other processed wind data for the years 2016 to 2024 (apply the same logic)
6) if you agree with me that venv should be excluded from git, update .gitignore accordingly
7) similalry as we tested a 2023 prediction, I'd like you to create a script that more generically, given any date in year 2025, runs a forecast test. Note that we may call this script from other files to run extensive testing over the 2025 data set. Make sure that the forecast is made until 6 pm, and that the text of any warnings present in the forecast (or the training data) is passed to the LLM.
8) Confirm that we are not using toon data for now for training. However, go back to the json to toon converter, and make sure that the conversion json to toon does NOT lose any information that we have in the JSON file (right now, a lot of information is lost!). Compare an existing json and its corresponding toon file to understand the problem and what I mean.
